# trailing_zeros: Count trailing zeros in a 64-bit number
Copyright (c) 2019 Bart Massey

This Rust library crate contains just one function,
`trailing_zeros::trailing_zeros`, which counts the number of
trailing zeros in a binary number using binary search. It's
substantially faster than counting na√Øvely.
